The above takes a data structure of nodes and links and creates a force-directed graph. 

Steps to development

1. Create nodes and links to describe system
2. Allow editable structure to add/delete nodes
3. Create forms to facilitate removal, deletion, editing of nodes/links
4. Allow users to update/edit by manipulating links/nodes directly
5. Allow association of information with the nodes
